## ⚠️ What You Need To Do

### Critical Setup Tasks:

### 1. 🗄️ Supabase Storage & Database (REQUIRED)

**You already have Supabase credentials in `.env`**, but you need to:

**Step A: Setup Storage Buckets**
1. Login to https://supabase.com
2. Go to your project: `tdqhynezvcpwcsldeaub.supabase.co`
3. Create two storage buckets:
   - `materials-pdfs` (Public)
   - `materials-thumbnails` (Public)
4. Setup RLS policies for uploads (see guide)

**Step B: Create Database Tables**
1. Go to SQL Editor in Supabase
2. Run the SQL from `COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` (Step 2.5)
3. This creates:
   - `materials` table
   - `material_downloads` table
   - RLS policies

**Why?** Without this:
- ❌ Admin can't upload study materials
- ❌ Materials won't display on the website
- ❌ Download tracking won't work

**Time needed**: 10-15 minutes

---

### 2. 👤 Create Admin Account (REQUIRED)

**Option A: Quick Method (Recommended)**
1. Go to Supabase → Authentication → Users
2. Click "Add User"
3. Email: `admin@sircbse.com`, Password: `admin123`
4. Check "Auto Confirm"
5. After creation, edit user and add metadata:
```json
{
  "name": "Admin User",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

**Option B: Via Website**
1. Register at your website
2. Then go to Supabase and add `"role": "admin"` to user metadata

**Why?** Without this:
- ❌ You can't access admin panel
- ❌ You can't add study materials
- ❌ You can't manage the platform

**Time needed**: 5 minutes

---

### 3. 💳 Verify Razorpay Account (IMPORTANT)

Your `.env` has LIVE Razorpay keys. You need to:

**Option A: Use Live Keys (For Production)**
- Verify your Razorpay account is KYC completed
- Verify keys are active in Razorpay dashboard
- Test with real payment (small amount)

**Option B: Switch to Test Keys (For Testing)**
1. Go to https://razorpay.com
2. Toggle to "Test Mode"
3. Generate test keys (rzp_test_xxx)
4. Update `.env` with test keys
5. Restart: `sudo supervisorctl restart nextjs`

**Test Card Numbers** (Test Mode only):
- Card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
- Expiry: Any future date
- CVV: Any 3 digits

**Why?** Without valid keys:
- ❌ Payment integration won't work
- ❌ Users can't purchase paid materials

**Time needed**: 5 minutes

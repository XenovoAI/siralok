# Download Management System - Setup Guide

## Overview
A complete download management system has been implemented for SIRCBSE that requires users to login before downloading any study materials. The system tracks downloads and ensures each user is counted only once per material.

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. **Authentication Enforcement**
- ‚úÖ Users MUST login/signup before downloading ANY material
- ‚úÖ Unauthenticated users are redirected to login page with return URL
- ‚úÖ After successful login/signup ‚Üí Auto-redirect back to materials page
- ‚úÖ Lock icon displayed on buttons when not logged in

### 2. **Download Tracking**
- ‚úÖ Each download is tracked in Supabase `material_downloads` table
- ‚úÖ One download count per user per material (unique constraint)
- ‚úÖ Subsequent downloads by same user don't increment counter
- ‚úÖ Toast notification shows "already counted" for repeat downloads

### 3. **Smart Redirect Flow**
- ‚úÖ Materials page ‚Üí Click download (not logged in) ‚Üí Login page
- ‚úÖ Login page ‚Üí Enter credentials ‚Üí Auto-redirect to materials page
- ‚úÖ Register page ‚Üí Create account ‚Üí Auto-redirect to materials page
- ‚úÖ Works with both "View" and "Download" buttons

## üìã Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Download Tracking Table in Supabase

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the contents of `/app/material_downloads_migration.sql`
5. Click **Run** to execute the migration

**What this creates:**
- `material_downloads` table with proper schema
- Indexes for fast lookups
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Unique constraint (user_id + material_id)

### Step 2: Verify Table Creation

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT * FROM material_downloads LIMIT 1;
```

You should see the table structure (empty initially).

### Step 3: Test the Flow

1. **Test as unauthenticated user:**
   - Go to `/materials` page
   - Try clicking "Download" on any material
   - Should redirect to `/login?returnUrl=/materials`

2. **Test signup flow:**
   - Create a new account
   - Should auto-redirect back to `/materials`
   - Click "Download" on a material
   - Should download successfully and show success toast

3. **Test download tracking:**
   - Download the same material again
   - Should show "Download started! (already counted)"
   - Check Supabase dashboard - only 1 record in `material_downloads` for that user+material

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

### `material_downloads` Table Structure

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key (auto-generated) |
| `user_id` | UUID | User who downloaded (from Supabase Auth) |
| `user_email` | TEXT | User's email for tracking |
| `material_id` | UUID | ID of downloaded material |
| `material_title` | TEXT | Title of material for reference |
| `material_type` | TEXT | 'free' or 'paid' (for future use) |
| `downloaded_at` | TIMESTAMP | When download occurred |

**Unique Constraint:** `(user_id, material_id)` - Ensures one download per user per material

---

## üîí Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

1. **SELECT Policy:** Users can only view their own download history
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own downloads" ON material_downloads
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id::text);
   ```

2. **INSERT Policy:** Users can only create download records for themselves
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own downloads" ON material_downloads
       FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = user_id::text);
   ```

This prevents users from:
- Viewing others' download history
- Creating fake download records for other users
- Manipulating download counts

## üìä Query Examples

WHERE user_id = 'USER_UUID'
ORDER BY downloaded_at DESC;
```

### Most Downloaded Materials:
```sql
SELECT 
    material_title,
    COUNT(*) as download_count
FROM material_downloads
GROUP BY material_id, material_title
ORDER BY download_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(downloaded_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as downloads
FROM material_downloads
GROUP BY DATE(downloaded_at)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Supabase Auth Required:** 
   - System uses Supabase authentication
   - User must be logged in via Supabase Auth
   - JWT token automatically handled by Supabase client

2. **Email Confirmation:**
   - If Supabase email confirmation is disabled (instant login) ‚Üí Works immediately
   - If enabled ‚Üí User must confirm email before downloading

3. **Materials Table:**
   - Must have `downloads` column (should already exist)
   - Downloads increment when new user downloads

4. **Browser Storage:**
   - Supabase auth state stored in localStorage
   - Session persists across page reloads

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Downloads Not Tracking?
- Check if `material_downloads` table exists
- Verify RLS policies are enabled
- Check browser console for errors

### Download Count Not Incrementing?
- Check if `materials` table has `downloads` column
- Verify Supabase update query is successful

### Redirect Not Working?
- Check if returnUrl is preserved in URL

- Check browser console for navigation errors

### User Not Logged In After Signup?

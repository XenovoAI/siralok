# Class 10 Materials Implementation Guide

## Overview
Added support for Class 10 materials (along with Class 11, Class 12, and Dropper) in the SIRCBSE platform. Users can now filter study materials by class and subject.

## Changes Made

### 1. Materials Page (`/app/app/materials/page.js`)
- **Added Class Filter**: New filter section above subject filter
  - Options: All, Class 10, Class 11, Class 12, Dropper
  - Purple/Pink gradient styling for active class filter
- **Class Badge**: Display class badge on material cards (top-left corner)
- **Updated Filter Logic**: Materials can now be filtered by both class and subject simultaneously

### 2. Admin Panel (`/app/app/admin/page.js`)
- **Class Field in Form**: Added dropdown to select class when creating/editing materials
  - Default: Class 11
  - Options: Class 10, Class 11, Class 12, Dropper
- **Class Badge on Cards**: Admin can see class badge on material cards
- **Form Validation**: Class field is required when adding new materials

### 3. Database Migration
- **File**: `add_class_field_migration.sql`
- **Run in Supabase SQL Editor**:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE materials ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS class TEXT DEFAULT 'Class 11';
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_materials_class ON materials(class);
  ```

- thumbnail_url: TEXT
- downloads: INTEGER

```

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Class filter above subject filter
2. **Color Coding**: 
   - Class filters: Purple/Pink gradient
   - Subject filters: Sky/Blue gradient
3. **Responsive Layout**: Buttons wrap on smaller screens
4. **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions
5. **Badge System**: Clear visual indicators for class and subject

## Migration Steps

1. **Run SQL Migration**:
   - Open Supabase Dashboard
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Run the migration from `add_class_field_migration.sql`

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Visit `/materials` page
   - Check if class filter appears
   - Try filtering by different classes

3. **Add New Materials**:
   - Login as admin
   - Go to `/admin`
   - Add materials with class field
   - Verify they appear with class badges

## Notes

- Existing materials without class field will default to "Class 11"
- Admin can edit existing materials to assign proper class
- Filters work independently (can select both class and subject)
- Search functionality works across class and subject filters

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Verify the SQL migration ran successfully
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Clear cache and reload the page
4. Ensure you're logged in as admin to access admin panel
